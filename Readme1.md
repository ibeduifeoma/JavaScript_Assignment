                                            what is DOM
The Document Object Model, or the “DOM”, is an interface to web pages. It is essentially an API to the page,
allowing programs to read and manipulate the page’s content, structure, and styles. Let’s break this down.
The DOM is an object-based representation of the source HTML document. It has some differences, as we will see below, 
but it is essentially an attempt to convert the structure and content of the HTML document into an object model that can be used by various programs.
The object structure of the DOM is represented by what is called a “node tree”. 
It is so called because it can be thought of as a tree with a single parent stem that branches out into several child branches, 
each which may have leaves. In this case, the parent “stem” is the root <html> element, the child “branches” are the nested elements,
and the “leaves” are the content within the elements.
